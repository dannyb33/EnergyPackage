# Ising Model Simulation Package

**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, NetworkX, Simulation & Modeling

---

## Overview

Built a modular Python package to simulate bitstring-based configurations and interactions using custom `BitString` and `IsingHamiltonian` classes.

Implemented both exact and Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate average values like energy and magnetization of systems at varying temperatures.

Used NetworkX to define and analyze graph-based systems, with optimized update methods for efficient simulation performance.
